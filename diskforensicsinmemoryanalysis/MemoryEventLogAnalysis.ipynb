    "# Disk Artifacts in memory\n",
    "Even though memory has several artifacts not found on disk it contains several traditionally disk based forensics artifacts that can be parsed and analyzed without taking a full disk image. The artifacts covered in this lesson are the following:\n",

    "Event logs house numerous artifact for incident response. The three main Windows event logs are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Security\n",
    "* System\n",
    "* Application\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more event logs then these and any applicaiton can create it's own event log. More recent relavent event logs are Powershell and Sysmon specific event logs which keep track of powershell command exection and Sysmon is an event log which can be customized to gather network and process exectuion similar to using the `sysmon` tool in malware analysis. Windows logs are stored in these directories on disk:\n",

    "Security event logs are where user logon and logoff activity are stored as well as if configured correctly process execution. Security event logs events are numerous but the main events to monitor for related to logon events are the following:\n",

The Application event log can contain any applications events with custom ID's and descriptions.
