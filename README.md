# Incident Response Labs and Scripts
This repository is a collection of labs and scripts to assit in learning incident response. You will need to follow the instructions below to utilize the labs. Some of the labs require more configurations but these steps should capture the base configurations. Make sure you have git installed before moving to the next steps.

## Python and Jupyter
For these labs we will be using Jupyter notebooks which allow us to interactively program and show the results as we step through the examples in the Labs. First you will need to install Anacondas Python. You can get Anaconds here:

https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows

Jupyter notebooks and several other analysis tools will be installed with this python distribution. Make sure to test your Jupyter installation before moving to the next step. 

## PowerShell Kernel for Juypter
The next set of tools you will need to install is a Jupyter Kernel for PowerShell. You can get this kernel and installation instructions here:

1. Install .NET SDK 5.0 or later
2. Open Up an Anacondas Powershell Console as Administrator
3. dotnet try jupyter install
4. dotnet interactive jupyter install

We will utilzie this kernel to interact with Windows command line and PowerShell in Jupyter.
